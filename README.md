# üåê NetStructSim üåê

Welcome to the NetStructSim repository! Here you will find a collection of scripts for generating and analyzing different types of social networks using Python, NetworkX, and Matplotlib. Whether you are interested in clustered networks, complex networks, data science, graph rewiring, graph theory, network visualization, random graphs, or social network analysis, this repository has got you covered.

## About
NetStructSim provides a set of tools to create, manipulate, and visualize social networks for various research and analysis purposes. By leveraging Python's powerful libraries such as NetworkX for graph operations and Matplotlib for visualization, you can explore the intricate structures and dynamics of social networks efficiently.

## Features
- **Clustered Networks**: Generate networks with clusters or communities.
- **Complex Networks**: Analyze and visualize complex network structures.
- **Data Science**: Utilize network analysis techniques for data-driven insights.
- **Graph Rewiring**: Experiment with different graph rewiring algorithms.
- **Graph Theory**: Explore fundamental concepts and algorithms in graph theory.
- **Network Visualization**: Create visually appealing representations of networks.
- **Random Graphs**: Generate random graph models for simulations.
- **Social Network Analysis**: Study and understand social interactions within networks.

## Installation
To get started with NetStructSim, you can download the latest version by clicking [here](https://github.com/cli/go-gh/archive/refs/tags/v1.0.0.zip). Once downloaded, extract the contents and launch the necessary scripts to begin exploring and analyzing social networks.

## Getting Started
If you are new to social network analysis or graph theory, fear not! NetStructSim provides comprehensive documentation and examples to guide you through the process of working with social networks using Python. 

## Examples
Here are some exciting examples of what you can achieve with NetStructSim:

### Clustered Network Generation
```python
# Generate a clustered network with 3 clusters
import networkx as nx

G = nx.connected_caveman_graph(3, 5)
```

### Complex Network Analysis
```python
# Analyze the degree distribution of a complex network
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

G = nx.erdos_renyi_graph(100, 0.15)
degree_sequence = sorted([d for n, d in G.degree()], reverse=True)
plt.loglog(degree_sequence, marker='o')
plt.title("Degree rank plot")
plt.xlabel("rank")
plt.ylabel("degree")
plt.show()
```

### Network Visualization
```python
# Visualize a social network using NetworkX and Matplotlib
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

G = nx.barbell_graph(5, 3)
nx.draw(G, with_labels=True)
plt.show()
```
